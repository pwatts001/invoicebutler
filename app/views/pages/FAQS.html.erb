                    Early settlement discount is the process by which buyers offer their suppliers early payment on invoices, in return for a small discount to the invoice value.

                    <p>Cash is King. Companies of all sizes need cash to purchase new supplies, make payroll, fund new projects, or pay down loans. While waiting for invoices to be paid, some companies are forced to slow production or take out a loan. But not all financing options are created equal. Invoicely’s early payments mean you’ll get the cash you need at a better rate than typical financing options.</p>
                    <p>For example, early settlement discounts through Invoicely typically sit between 8-12% APR. This compares extremely favorably versus a typical credit card with 18+% APR, a factoring company with 25+% APR, or 2/10 net 30 terms with a 36% APR. What’s more, there are no additional contracts, hidden fees or 3rd party complications and no additional debt on your balance sheet.</p>
